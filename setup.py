        ElemSymPoly is a high-performance C library with Python bindings that utilizes the GNU MPFR Library for 
        precise computation of Elementary Symmetric Polynomials and a custom FFT implimentation. \n
        
        The Library is currently in development stage and not production ready. \n
        
        The library is based on applying a divide and conquer approach to compute the elementary symmetric polynomials. \n
        
        First, the elementary symmetric polynomials of order N is expressed as a product of N order 1 polynomials. \n
        
        Next, using a divide and conquer approach, the product of N order 1 polynomials is computed by recursively. \n
        
        After a certain arbitrary threshold (currently set to 8), the polynomials of order 8 or above are computed using FFT. \n
        
        The FFT algorithm is a custom implementation of the classic recursive Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm. \n
        
        This algorithim has a time complexity of O( N log^2 N ) compared to the naive approach of O( N^2 ) and also has
        arbitrary precision support (currently up to 512 decimal places due to stack overflow concerns). \n
        
        The library also has a Python wrapper for ease of use, and only relies on NumPy, GNU MPFR which in turn relies on
        GNU GMP, Python C headers, CMake, glibc and a C compiler (only tested with GCC). \n
